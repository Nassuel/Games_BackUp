# Games_BackUp
Repository which holds the code to backup saved data files.

### File is missing my directory paths for security
The setup that I have is:
```
file_location = {
    'in_origin': <origin to my back up file>,
    'in_dest_path': <destination path of where the files will be backed up to>,
    'in_cleanup_dest_path': <path where previous files will be moved to>
}
```
